Please note that for the run_analysis.R file to work, the working directory
should be the one where the "Project Files Dataset" folder is located.
The following are the names of parameters tested in the experiment
unfortunately, a concise description was not made available by the researchers, 
and I have made little
headway in attempting to solve this.
The description is available in "features.txt", which is also available in this repo.
The description of what my code does is available in the repo's ReadMe file, and the run_analysis.R file contains detailed description of the coding itself 
In addition to the variables, there were also "subject", which identifies each of the participants with a unique integer in the range 1-30, and "activity", which detailed what activity the subject was engaged in during the measurement. These included walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs,sitting, standing and laying,
